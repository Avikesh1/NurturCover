        <h3>Benefit of the NurturCover</h3>
            The policy extends beyond standard funeral cover by including a monthly rewards program, 
            which becomes available after three months of continuous premium payments. 
            In addition, all plans offer access to discounted rates on coffins and tombstones as part of the benefits package. 
            Once memberships are established, we also plan to introduce an optional add-on program to further enhance the value of the policy.

        <h3>Why Monthly Rewards</h3>
            The monthly rewards program transforms funeral cover from being viewed solely as an expense into a meaningful investment—enhancing customer retention for the insurer while ensuring policyholders feel valued during their lifetime.
